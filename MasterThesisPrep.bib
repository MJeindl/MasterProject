  abstract  = {Recording of transient absorption microscopy images requires fast detection of minute optical density changes, which is typically achieved with high-repetition-rate laser sources and lock-in detection. Here, we present a highly flexible and cost-efficient detection scheme based on a conventional photodiode and an USB oscilloscope with MHz bandwidth, that deviates from the commonly used lock-in setup and achieves benchmark sensitivity. Our scheme combines shot-to-shot evaluation of pump\&\#x2013;probe and probe\&\#x2013;only measurements, a home-built photodetector circuit optimized for low pulse energies applying low-pass amplification, and a custom evaluation algorithm based on Fourier transformation. Advantages of this approach include abilities to simultaneously monitor multiple pulse modulation frequencies, implement the detection of additional pulse sequences (e.g., pump\&\#x2013;only), and expand to multiple parallel detection channels for wavelength-dispersive probing. With a 40\&\#x2009;kHz repetition-rate laser system powering two non-collinear optical parametric amplifiers for wide tuneability, we find that laser pulse fluctuations limit the sensitivity of the setup, while the detection scheme has negligible contribution. We demonstrate the 2-D imaging performance of our transient absorption microscope with studies on micro-crystalline molecular thin films.},

  abstract = {{ Multiphoton microscopy has rapidly gained popularity in biomedical imaging and materials science because of its ability to provide three-dimensional images at high spatial and temporal resolution even in optically scattering environments. Currently the majority of commercial and home-built devices are based on two-photon fluorescence and harmonic generation contrast. These two contrast mechanisms are relatively easy to measure but can access only a limited range of endogenous targets. Recent developments in fast laser pulse generation, pulse shaping, and detection technology have made accessible a wide range of optical contrasts that utilize multiple pulses of different colors. Molecular excitation with multiple pulses offers a large number of adjustable parameters. For example, in two-pulse pump-probe microscopy, one can vary the wavelength of each excitation pulse, the detection wavelength, the timing between the excitation pulses, and the detection gating window after excitation. Such a large parameter space can provide much greater molecular specificity than existing single-color techniques and allow for structural and functional imaging without the need for exogenous dyes and labels, which might interfere with the system under study. In this review, we provide a tutorial overview, covering principles of pump-probe microscopy and experimental setup, challenges associated with signal detection and data processing, and an overview of applications. }},

This Review addresses key factors that determine the dye photostability. It is shown that photodegradation can follow different oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent mechanisms and may involve both 1S1–3T1 and higher-energy 1Sn–3Tn excited states. Their involvement and contribution depends on dye structure, medium conditions, irradiation power. Fluorescein, rhodamine, BODIPY and cyanine dyes, as well as conjugated polymers are discussed as selected examples illustrating photobleaching mechanisms. The strategies for modulating and improving the photostability are overviewed. They include the improvement of fluorophore design, particularly by attaching protective and anti-fading groups, creating proper medium conditions in liquid, solid and nanoscale environments. The special conditions for biological labeling, sensing and imaging are outlined.},

For the general case{,} this evolution is described by means of a step model interpolating between collision-free reorientation and Brownian diffusion for different geometries. The presented ansatz is able to calculate the time dependence of the anisotropy for symmetric top molecules. This dependence is shown to be in third order with respect to the solvent–solute interaction irrespective of the molecular geometry. Differences to former models are worked out and an extension to rotational coherence effects is given. Finally{,} the influence of collisions on the anisotropy decay is modeled by Monte-Carlo simulations allowing for a variation of angular correlation and energy transfer.},

To enable its incorporation in these devices in a convenient{,} scalable{,} and economical way{,} BiOI thin films were investigated as part of heterojunctions with various p-type organic semiconductors (OSCs) and tested in a field-effect transistor (FET) configuration. The hybrid heterojunctions{,} which combine the respective functionalities of BiOI and the OSCs were processed from solution under ambient atmosphere. The characteristics of each of these hybrid systems were correlated with the physical and chemical properties of the respective materials using a concept based on heteropolar chemical interactions at the interface. Systems suitable for application in lateral transport devices were identified and it was demonstrated how materials in the hybrids interact to provide improved and synergistic properties. These indentified heterojunction FETs are a first instance of successful incorporation of solution-processed BiOI thin films in a three-terminal device. They show a significant threshold voltage shift and retained carrier mobility compared to pristine OSC devices and open up possibilities for future optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract = {The process of singlet-exciton fission (SEF) has attracted much attention of late. One of the most popular SEF compounds is TIPS-pentacene (TIPS-P, where TIPS = triisopropylsilylethynyl) but, despite its extensive use as both a reference and building block, its photophysical properties are not so well established. In particular, the triplet state excitation energy remains uncertain. Here, we report quantitative data and spectral characterization for excited-singlet and -triplet states in dilute solution. The triplet energy is determined to be 7940 ± 1200 cm−1 on the basis of sensitization studies using time-resolved photoacoustic calorimetry. The triplet quantum yield at the limit of low concentration and low laser intensity is only ca. 1%. Self-quenching occurs at high solute concentration where the fluorescence yield and lifetime decrease markedly relative to dilute solution but we were unable to detect excimer emission by steady-state spectroscopy. Short-lived fluorescence, free from excimer emission or phosphorescence, occurs for crystals of TIPS-P, most likely from amorphous domains.},
