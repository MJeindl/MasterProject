  abstract  = {Recording of transient absorption microscopy images requires fast detection of minute optical density changes, which is typically achieved with high-repetition-rate laser sources and lock-in detection. Here, we present a highly flexible and cost-efficient detection scheme based on a conventional photodiode and an USB oscilloscope with MHz bandwidth, that deviates from the commonly used lock-in setup and achieves benchmark sensitivity. Our scheme combines shot-to-shot evaluation of pump\&\#x2013;probe and probe\&\#x2013;only measurements, a home-built photodetector circuit optimized for low pulse energies applying low-pass amplification, and a custom evaluation algorithm based on Fourier transformation. Advantages of this approach include abilities to simultaneously monitor multiple pulse modulation frequencies, implement the detection of additional pulse sequences (e.g., pump\&\#x2013;only), and expand to multiple parallel detection channels for wavelength-dispersive probing. With a 40\&\#x2009;kHz repetition-rate laser system powering two non-collinear optical parametric amplifiers for wide tuneability, we find that laser pulse fluctuations limit the sensitivity of the setup, while the detection scheme has negligible contribution. We demonstrate the 2-D imaging performance of our transient absorption microscope with studies on micro-crystalline molecular thin films.},

  abstract = {{ Multiphoton microscopy has rapidly gained popularity in biomedical imaging and materials science because of its ability to provide three-dimensional images at high spatial and temporal resolution even in optically scattering environments. Currently the majority of commercial and home-built devices are based on two-photon fluorescence and harmonic generation contrast. These two contrast mechanisms are relatively easy to measure but can access only a limited range of endogenous targets. Recent developments in fast laser pulse generation, pulse shaping, and detection technology have made accessible a wide range of optical contrasts that utilize multiple pulses of different colors. Molecular excitation with multiple pulses offers a large number of adjustable parameters. For example, in two-pulse pump-probe microscopy, one can vary the wavelength of each excitation pulse, the detection wavelength, the timing between the excitation pulses, and the detection gating window after excitation. Such a large parameter space can provide much greater molecular specificity than existing single-color techniques and allow for structural and functional imaging without the need for exogenous dyes and labels, which might interfere with the system under study. In this review, we provide a tutorial overview, covering principles of pump-probe microscopy and experimental setup, challenges associated with signal detection and data processing, and an overview of applications. }},

  abstract  = {Photochemical stability is one of the most important parameters that determine the usefulness of organic dyes in different applications. This Review addresses key factors that determine the dye photostability. It is shown that photodegradation can follow different oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent mechanisms and may involve both 1S1–3T1 and higher-energy 1Sn–3Tn excited states. Their involvement and contribution depends on dye structure, medium conditions, irradiation power. Fluorescein, rhodamine, BODIPY and cyanine dyes, as well as conjugated polymers are discussed as selected examples illustrating photobleaching mechanisms. The strategies for modulating and improving the photostability are overviewed. They include the improvement of fluorophore design, particularly by attaching protective and anti-fading groups, creating proper medium conditions in liquid, solid and nanoscale environments. The special conditions for biological labeling, sensing and imaging are outlined.},
