\chapter{Devices and Setup}



Part of the experimental objective was to extend the range of the transient absorption microscope (TAM) into the UV range via SHG of the probe NOPA output. With the extension a wavelength range of 250 nm to 940 nm, with a gap between 470 nm and 500 nm, is available for probing the sample.\newline
To achieve this range a few optics, most notably the achromatic objectives used to image the sample, had to be exchanged for optics non absorbing in the UV.
\section{Regular Transient Absorption Microscope Setup}\label{RegTAM}
A short description of the experimental setup for the Transient Absorption Microscope (TAM), as it was before attempting an extension to higher photon energies follows. For further details see previous work (cite robert master thesis)\\
As a laser source a PHAROS femtosecond laser by Light Conversion is used with an output of 400 ÂµJ at 20 kHz with a pulse length in the range of ....? The output is evenly split between two Orpheus Non-Collinear Optical Parametric Amplifiers (NOPAs), where one is setup with second harmonic (2H) for the pump pulses (650 nm - 940 nm) and the other is setup with third harmonic (3H) for the probe pulses (500 nm - 940 nm). Long term output power stability is mainly important for the pump pulse, which is why the setup, including the compressor the PHAROS, is optimized for maximum stability of the 2H NOPA. Meanwhile having little shot to shot fluctuations is important in all cases. PHAROS is the most reliable part of the setup, with exception of the compression setting which may need adjusting every once upon a while.\\

The light following the pump path goes through several apertures and ND filters, which may be absorptive glass filters or metal coated reflective filters which may also be gradient filters for linear adjustability, until the beam reaches the linear delay stage, which uses a Newpot LTA-HS actuator. The beam path is then led through the chopper by the use of a roughly 1:1 telescope around it, which blocks every second pulse leaving a half frequency signal for the pump. The chopper is synchronised to a signal output of PHAROS, which allows for setting a delay such that there is just a binary on and off modulation of the pump, compared to a partial chopping of beams at full frequency. After passing through a lambda half wave plate the beam enters the common path in the cage with the sample.

The probe beam has the same treatment of apertures and ND filters, including a variable reflective one, and goes through a lambda/2 plate until it reaches the common path.


For detection of the transient signal a custom made detector based on Hamamatsu S1336-8BQ (some way to check this? robert's thesis says BK which would be the wrong one for UV) Si photodiode is used in combination with an analogue long pass amplification circuit stretching the signal such that it can be measured with an Oscilloscope with ??? MT frequency. For all measurements detector "A" was used. The diode is fit for measurements in the wavelength range of 190-1100  nm and ....? Find datasheet and plot wavelength vs signal.

\section{UV extended Transient Absorption Microscope Setup}
This section will address the issues addressed with the extended setup as well as attempted solutions and the final changes to make it work.
\subsection{Cage setup}
To accomodate the lower wavelengths the objectives have to be exchanged for wavelengths below 350 nm, where absorption reduces the transmission of the objective combination severely. Furthermore only one of the objectives is rated down to 350 nm raising the question of if their achromacity still is a viable assumption.\newline
The objectives are replaced with  uncoated 125 nm plano-convex UV fused silica (UVFS) lenses from EKSMA\footnote{?110-1216E?}, with the convex side placed such that the collimated beam enters or exits the convex side. This means that the planar sides of the lenses point towards the sample.
\newline
The plano-convex lenses are neither apochromatic nor achromatic and thus exhibit chromatic aberration, leading to an issue that will be addressed in \ref{SHG-Stage-desc}. \newline

\subsection{Second Harmonic Generation stage}\label{SHG-Stage-desc}
The Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) stage addresses multiple issues. 
Firstly the 3H NOPA used for the probe beam does not supply high enough power to 
\begin{itemize}
\item The 3H NOPA used for the probe beam does not supply high enough power to allow for stable SHG over the entire output wavelength range of the NOPA without a focusing element increasing the power locally within the crystal. 
\item The chromatic abberation or focus shift within the cage system means that a degree of freedom on the focus of the probe needs to be included as to allow for adjustments to the pointspread function of the probe.
\end{itemize}


The solution to these issues is an adjustable telescope of biconvex lenses, of which the second lens is UV transmissive. To achieve a stable second harmonic generation (SHG) a telescope was built with two spherical lenses. The front lens is a 85 mm lens in a mount adjustable for horizontal and vertical displacement orthogonal to the beam path and the rear lens is a 75 mm UVFS lens on a linear stage, to provide a degree of freedom for the focus of the probe beam, which is necessary to account for the achromacity of the extended setup.
\subsubsection{Operation}
\paragraph{Setting up}
The task of setting up the SHG stage is non trivial regarding proper alignment and linear stage positioning, such that the ~5 cm of movement are sufficient to adjust for the chromatic aberration within the targeted wavelength range for probe. This task often ends up being trial and error in correspondence to checking multiple wavelengths. The cage lenses have to be in their correct positions first.\newline
Irises etc are beneficial if there is a working setup.\newline
Use irises to shape the probe beam to an acceptable Gaussian shape while avoiding diffraction effects. Optimally the incoming beam is level with the table, since any inclination will introduce an astigmatism? depending on the rear lens position.\newline
Begin with the first lens in the path leaving enough space for the linear stage and the SHG crystal to the next static optic. Set lens centered regarding beam. Use the irises in front of the lens to adjust the reflection on the lens surface to return the exact incoming beampath.\newline
Place the rear stage lens and once again adjust for center position. One may again use the reflection and additionally the transmitted beam to tell if the stage is parallel to the beam path. The center of the beam should not move when translating the stage and the expansion of the beam diameter should be as symmetric as possible. Adjusting via the reflection is not such a clear indication of alignment here, as there are multiple convex surfaces in play at this point, leading to multiple focal beams, what may not be in full accordance with each other. For this usually it was chosen to get the highest intensity spot, which refers to the final glass/air surface of the second lens, in the incoming beam path. This spot is also focused, which makes adjustment easier.\newline
Finally one can adjust mirrors after the stage to get an image on the camera again, as even relatively minute changes in alignment will lead to some beam offset and change in direction. Translating the stage then will give an indication of how well the SHG stage is set up in regards to astigmatism which can be seen as non symmetric expansion of the beam. However beware that the mirror outcoupling in the cage also influences the way a change in focus is experienced, due to deviations from an orthogonal inclination angle to the sensor.
\paragraph{For measurements}
To find SHG intensity approach from the incoming beam direction and adjust SHG crystal until sufficient output power is achieved.\newline
Adjust the linear stage such that there is no lateral movement. The current stage slide is mounted in a way that can rotate a bit if force is applied at the corners. It may be necessary to do this and have the stage "snap back" to make sure it will not move during the measurement. This can be checked after the measurement by checking the overlap again.
\subsection{Detector Setup}
The detectors themselves are the same as in ...cite robert.... For the measurements detector A was used at all times in combination with a picoscope ???. An unspecified prism UV translucent, equal sided prism is also inserted to remove any remainders of the fundamental probe wavelength at the detector. To improve this separation an extra iris may be used immediately in front of the detector.
\subsection{Adjusting overlap without achromatic optics}
One of the main issues that had to be addressed was the change from achromatic objectives to uncoated plano-convex lenses within the cage.\newline
This is emphasized especially by plotting the wavelength dependence of the focal length as defined by the lensmaker equation:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{f} = (n-1) \left[\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{(n-1)d}{n R_1 R_2}\right]
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.9\linewidth]{images/ChromaticAbberation.png}
\caption{Refractive index change and focal shift for UVFS plano convex lenses}
\end{figure}
This issue is of fundamental nature and a few attempts were made until the final solution in .... was found.
\subsubsection{Regular Focusing after Cage}
This is the option used for the regular TAM setup as described in \ref{RegTAM}. The last mirror in front of the detector is simply removed to reveal a camera behind it. The rear cage objective is focused onto this camera using white light from an LED torch or similar lightsources in transmission. Afterwards the front objective is moved such that a satisfactory pointspread function of the beam is seen from the camera sensor.\\ 
This is sufficient as the achromatic objectives allow a very similar focus for all wavelengths between 400 nm and 940 nm. The rear objective simply projects the pointspread function of the beams in the plane of the sample to which it was focused to, while moving the front objective adjusts the part of the focusing beam cone, and thus the size of the slice of the beam, which interacts with the sample. This is working for both pump and probe.\\
Since the focal length of the lenses varies wildly in the UV this is not an option for the UV extension.
\subsubsection{Dummy Conversion Sample}
An idea was to use a "dummy" sample acting as a screen to then be imaged onto the camera in the rear using the lens. This method has several requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item The screen needs to allow for diffuse imaging of the sample without disturbing the beamshape too much.
\item Any UV or near UV light needs to be converted to the visible region, where the focal length difference becomes negligible.
\end{itemize}

The requirement for diffuse imaging is simple. Any collimation or focusing action of the beam needs to be lost to actually image the sample plane, where the "dummy" is placed at. The requirement is less stringent for wavelengths close to a chosen wavelength to which the setup would be calibrated to, as the lenses would image the beam fine for that wavelength.\\


\chapter{Software}
\section{Overlap Compensation}
Opposed to the old setup, where the achromatic objectives guaranteed relatively consistent overlap of pump and probe, the UV setup has the need to correct the variation between the single measurements, since the diffraction of the dispersive elements in the probe path varies strongly in the UV range and any compensation via the telescope will be imperfect.\newline
Relevant for this are the beam size of the probe as well as the overlap of the pump and the probe beam in the sample. Variations in those parameters are induced by change of the beamshape due to SHG generation, imperfect alignment of the SHG telescope and correction of the chromatic aberration for different wavelength settings of the probe.\newline

\subsection{Correction Factor}
The correction factor aims to equilibrate the dOD of the given pump-probe overlap to one where the pump is constant in radiance over the entire probe area or in a physical description is infinitely larger than the probe beam.
Thus for very high $\mathrm{\frac{\sigma_{Probe}}{\sigma_{Pump}} \rightarrow \infty}$ the correction factor tends to 1, which is the smallest value.\\
The factor is calculated from the Gaussian intensity distributions as seen in eq. \ref{CorrFactorGaussians}. The enumerator is the integral over essentially the probe intensity with the constant factor of the maximum pump intensity 
\begin{equation*}
I_{pump}^* = c^* = max(I_{pump}(x)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2*\pi}*\sigma_{pump}}
\end{equation*}, which is 1 due to the intensity taken as a Gaussian or normal distribution. The denominator is the integral over the product of the fitted normal distributions of pump and probe beams called $\mathrm{S_{12}}$.

\begin{equation}\label{CorrFactorGaussians}
C = \dfrac{\int I_{pump}^*\cdot I_{probe}(x) \;dx}{\int I_{pump}(x)\cdot I_{probe}(x) \; dx} = \dfrac{c^*\cdot \int I_{probe} dx}{S_{12}}
\end{equation}

\begin{gather}
I_1(x)\cdot I_2(x) = I_{12}(x) = S_{12}\cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_{new}} exp\left(-\frac{\left(x-\mu_{new}\right)^2}{2\cdot\sigma_{12}^2}\right)\\
\int I_{12}(x)\; dx \coloneqq S_{12} \cdot 1\\
\sigma_{new} = \dfrac{\sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2}{\sqrt{\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2}}\\
\mu_{new} = \dfrac{\mu_1\sigma_2^2 + \mu_2\sigma_1^2}{\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2}
\end{gather}



\begin{equation}
S_{12} = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\left(\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2\right)}}\cdot exp\left(-\dfrac{\left(\mu_1 - \mu_2\right)^2}{2\cdot \left(\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2\right)}\right)
\end{equation}
A few examples of the behavior of the correction factor are shown in fig.

Furthermore to have all values be comparable the correction factor is divided by the peak radiance value.

\section{Artray-LiveFitting}
As the Artray $\mathrm{ARTCAM-092UV-WOM}$ could not be interfaced with matlab using the webcam library a C\# program was created based on the manufacturers example program.
Issues with our system are that for our specific camera or system setup, it is not decided which part has the problem, a periodic variation of low intensity signal is reported by the C\# based program, while this periodic variation is missing in the official software. Attempts were made to troubleshoot this in correspondence with the manufacturer, who were very forthcoming in the matter, but it could not be solved so far. To overcome this problem a simple background subtraction has been devised as sufficient. The background has been recorded with the lens cap on and....
\newline
For all measurements included here version 1.2 was used. The  ALGLIB software package is used and (version number)\footnote{ALGLIB for C\# licensed as per GPL 2} for fitting a Gaussian to the beamshape.\

\chapter{Examination of reliability}
Some tests have been done to ascertain the validity and stability of the corrections devised for the UV extended TAM.
